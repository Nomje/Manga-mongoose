# Technologies Used

>Mongoose / MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Html, and Ejs

# Approach

> For most of the project I took inspiration form a class lesson plan but there were some instances were I had to look at some sites that detailed crud to get the implementation of crud. the design i intended for came from manga sites I use for reading and wanted to make so i only need to go to one place to get all my manga not multiple sites.

## What went well

>The initial creation of the manga was the easiest task of the project and most of the steps till the update function were not hard to figure out.

## Hurdles

>Stylizing the the pages cause it seems like you are doing general stylizing and not just for individual pages unless you have a bunch of classes and ids. the other Major hurdle was getting the ability to edit a review made  my the user. The user was able to enter the update but it seems like it was just getting the req.body and then instead of updating the review the function would just throw the new review away/ not save it and this was a hindrance since Wednesday.  

## IceBox

 - Enable an api to generate metadata for the user so that there is a bigger spread of manga for the user to browse through.
 - A search bar so that the user can look up the intended manga instead of scrolling the whole collection
 - Have feature so the user can favorite a manga and have those at the top of the collection 
 - Have a moderation team/ users who will approve added mangas that a user would like to add or the team will show you that the manga they want to add is already in the collection
